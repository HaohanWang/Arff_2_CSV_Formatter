=============

This is a very light python file that can format .arff file into .csv file.     

Just put the .arff file into folder inputData and then run the script.    

what's in temp folder will disappear after running, so just leave it there is fine.    

I upload this file hoping that sometimes it will help someone, but after I finish writing I found that there are so many much better and roboust formatter with the same function   

But I still upload mine. :-)
